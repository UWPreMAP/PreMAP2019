These stars are useful to astronomers because their flux varies in a predictable sinusoidal pattern. It turns out that the period of the flux oscillation is directly related to how intrinsically bright the star is – so if you know how long the period is, and you measure how dim the star _appears_ to be, you can estimate how far away it is because you know how bright it really is.\n",
