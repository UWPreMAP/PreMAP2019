Bio: Kristen is a fourth year PhD student in the Department of Astronomy at the University of Washington. Prior to coming to UW she received her BS in Astrophysics and Physics from Michigan State University. Kristen considers astronomy to be a great “gateway science,” so when she’s not working on her own research she volunteers with UW’s Mobile Planetarium as a presenter and act as co-organizer and presenter for Astronomy on Tap Seattle. Aside from astronomy, Kristen is very interested in hiking and backpacking.
