    "## Writing Functions Python\n",
    "\n",
    "You have already seen how to use built-in modules (e.g. numpy) in python and the functions that accompany them. Now we will learn how to write our own functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions in python are of the following form: \n",
    "```python \n",
    "def function_name(argument_1, argument_2,..., keyword_argument_1=val1, keyword_argument_2=val2, ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `argument_1` and `argument_2` are \"arguments\" and are required, and `keyword_argument_1` and `keyword_argument_2` are called \"keyword arguments\" and are optional. The names of python functions can be any combination of lowercase letters, numbers and underscores as long as they don't start with a number, and as long as they are not already the name of a built-in keyword (i.e. `print`). Let's look at a very simple example of a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "### First example: the `add` function\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a simple function: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(x, y):\n",
    "    \"\"\"This function adds x to y.\"\"\"\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "This function adds the argument `x` to the argument `y`. You indicate that you're _defining_ a function with the `def` statement, then comes the name of the function, then (no spaces here) comes parentheses containing the arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The arguments `x` and `y` are symbols -- a user could call the function on variables that they define, which need not be called `x` and `y`. Here, they just define that within the function, you will refer to the first argument as `x` and the second as `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `return` line needs to be indented with respect to the `def` line. Next to the word `return`, you write the result that you want the function to output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The line in triple-quotes is called a _docstring_. It is documentation, or user instructions. Most Python functions contain information in the docstring that will help you figure out how to use the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now _call_ this function like so:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(x, y):\n",
    "    \"\"\"This function adds x to y.\"\"\"\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "a = 5\n",
    "b = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "a_plus_b = add(a, b)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(a_plus_b)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note_ that the variables that are defined within a function (`x` and `y` in this example), cannot be accessed outside of the function. If you try to print `x` at the bottom of the code above, you'll see: \n",
    "```\n",
    "NameError: name 'x' is not defined\n",
    "```\n",
    "because the variable name `x` only exists within the function. This concept is called _scope_.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, copy and paste the recipe above for addition. Modify it to multiply two numbers together, and don't forget to change the function name and docstring accordingly."

    "In this next example, you'll write a function that converts brightness measurements of stars in *magnitudes* to *solar luminosities* ($L_{\\odot}$). \n",

    "The magnitude system in astronomy derives from a system devised by ancient Greeks (Hipparcus, in particular), who catalogued the brightnesses of stars visually with their eyes. The magnitude system, like the Richter scale for earthquakes or the decibel scale for sound, is a *logarithmic* scale that measures the brightness of astronomical objects. Because of this strange convention, the smaller the value is in magnitude, the brighter an object is: e.g., a -1.5 magnitude star is brighter than a +2 magnitude star. An increase in magnitude by 2.5 means an object is a factor of 10 dimmer.\n",

    "Flux (W/m$^2$, or power per unit area) is a unit of measurement you're familiar with for measuring the brightness of objects; the solar flux, or how bright the sun is at Earth's distance, is 1377 W/m$^2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Converting between magnitude and flux is easy, although perhaps not intuitive. If two stars have fluxes $F_A$ and $F_B$, their magnitudes $m_A$ and $m_B$ can be related via:\n",

    "$m_A - m_B = -2.5 \\log (F_A/F_B)$\n",
